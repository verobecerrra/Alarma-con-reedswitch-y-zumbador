*Objective of the program: the objective of the program is to simulate an alarm using a REED SWITCH and a BUZZER.
 If the magnetic field of the REED SWITCH is interfered with by some signal, it sends a signal to the BUZZER and the LED so that it
 turn on simulating the alarm with sound and light.

int reedswitch = 5; //variable of the REED SWITCH initialized in 5
int buzzer = 8; //variable of the BUZZER initialized in 8

// the method setup Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output
void setup(){

  pinMode(reedswitch, INPUT); //configure the REED SWITCH pin to behave like an input

}

/* the loop method is responsible for validating if the value of the REED SWHITCH is in the LOW state, 
if it is true it changes the pins of the LED and from the BUZZER to HIGH,
in case the REED SWITCH pin is in the HIGH state, change the LED and BUZZER pins to LOW
